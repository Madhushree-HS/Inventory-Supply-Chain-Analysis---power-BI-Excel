<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>ðŸ“˜ Overview</h2>

This project focuses on analyzing inventory and supply chain performance metrics to optimize warehouse operations, reduce transportation costs, and improve overall efficiency. The dashboard provides a holistic view of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as warehouse utilization, inventory turnover, lead time, and backorders.
